<dd>New: Item count display in the quest window, and the quest tracker window. Both have to be enabled in the settings (clothcalc has a similar feature).
<dd>New: Banking helpers:
	<ul>
	<li>A click on the money in the bank (at the top of the game) allows you to deposit your cash, if you are in a town. This is enabled by default.
	<li>You can be asked if you want to deposit your money if you reach your home town. This has to be enabled in the settings, because clothcalc has the same feature, and it would be annoying be asked twice.
	</ul>
<dd>New: Enhancements to the auction window (like clothcalc did). These are turned off by default, because clothcalc does the same, and <b>because there are a number of rough edges</b> (meaning: this feature is not completed). It is here because it is usable.
<dd>New: Option to create a button in the graveyard, leading to basic fortbattle statistics. Yes, i mean basic. I did not dig into the per-round data.
<dd>New: the settings are ordered.
<dd>Bugfix: if an english translation was missing, at warning was issued on the console. This was not meant to be.
<dd>Bugfix: if translations in another language were missing, they were logging as often as they were used. This was unneeded.
