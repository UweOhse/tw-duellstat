<dt>0.57 - 2023-10-26
<dd>New: a fix for the tailors scrollbar. Oh, inno.
<dd>New: an alternative to clothcalcs pinning, also called pinning (quick access might be better?)
<dd>New: a replacement for clothcalcs duel status bar. You should deactivate either that or that of clothcalc.
<dd>Improvement: the market sale window information for the bulk mode can be turned off.
<dd>Improvement: the crafting window has a filter for items with a block time.
<dd>Improvement: the smart start feature in the job window (start multiple jobs at the same time) now considers the current task queue.
<dd>Improvement: the simulator (extra) now shows all jobs, not just one, and compares the equipment against the cached best (it has a filter function to reduce the number of results).
<dd>Improvement: the simulator has a set select, which allows to 'wear' all items of the set. This comes with a filter function, as the set selection is a major pain.
<dd>Improvement: the filter function also applies to the item selection.
<dd>Improvement: the itemuse / chest content now knows about the DoD event.
<dd>Improvement: the itemuse / chest content display allows to delete a line.
<dd>Bugfix: the final message shown after a bulk update of the clothcache (the functions in the settings) contained the word "undefined".
<dd>Bugfix: the simulator failed if an item combo didn't have a needed attribute.

<dt>0.56 - 2023-10-14 
<dd>Improvement: the market offer window (MOW) now shows the name of the thing in the title, like the travelling merchant sale does.
<dd>Improvement: the MOW now has a bulk mode. Use this if you trigger the "streak of bad luck" when selling on the market. The bulk mode causes the updates to the inventory and the list of items you sell to be updated only if you paused 8 seconds while selling.
<dd>Improvement: added a function to the MOW to add some percent of the current price. This is also a workaround for certain worlds where you can't sell named stuff at the minimum price, but have to use the immediate purchase price.
<dd>Improvement: a function to delete entries from the storage with match a given search string.
<dd>Improvement: a function to calculate the target sums in the storage from the comments.
<dd>Improvement: the inventory statistic shows the event currencies (hearts, pretzels and such things).
<dd>Improvement: added a 'missing item' filter to the market. Finally.
<dd>Improvement: added many missing translations, and display missing, but intended, translations to the logging.
<dd>Improvement: added a quick hack to include and display only a part of the update information with the script.
<dd>Change: removed the fix for the compost filter display, as tw-calc includes a fix now.
<dd>Bugfix: the storage showed all products (display problem).
<dd>Bugfix: the crafting resources filter in the market did nothing.
<dd>Bugfix: the tabular inventory item sell function used the wrong town (and even that was not done correctly), causing wrong fees to be shown.

<dt>0.55 - 2023-09-24 
<dd>New: renamed the thing to clothcache. goodbye, duellstat.
<dd>New: fortbattle chat: a click on the player name highlight the position on the battle field.
<dd>New: fortbattle chat: shows health points and health point losses in each round.
<dd>New: it's possible to highlight the messages button in the bottom row with a red border if there is a new tele. This is not too beautiful, but works, and has to be enable in the options (misc). Note that group teles also trigger the function, so... don't you hate group teles? 
<dd>New: an inventory statistics (extra). your inventories worth, the worth of the useless stuff, bonds in letter, exp. potions (% of level thing). Some things might be useful, some things are missing (like how many easter egg (think points, not buffs) i already have for the next event).
<dd>New: a new extra "iteminfo". Type in the number of the thing, and you'll see what's known about it. it's for me, not for you.
<dd>New: minimap: add a quick and dirty display of the tracked job groups to the county map. this is not useful if you have many open jobs, but nice there are just a few.
<dd>New: added an achievements page to the extras. it really helps if you need to find an achievement, and don't want to read 31 pages for that. there's a search function, too.
<dd>New: a new extra "buffs" lists all known buffs in the game. it's sortable. 

<dd>Improvement: craftcalc window shows the number of resources available, allows to buy / sell them on the market, and also allows a bit more flexibility when dividing resources. 
<dd>Improvement: chest statistics now includes the wins of the pretzel event. rockets event, too. Wow, it's been a long time since 0.54.
<dd>Improvement: storage: show if a silver/gold job is known.
<dd>Improvement: you can add short note into the title of the job window (far left of the title, needs to be enabled in the settings). You might use this to remember which bonus equipment you can use, or whatever you need, but keep it short.
<dd>Improvement: show which job drops an collectible (0.54 added the reverse thing).
<dd>Improvement: inventory shows the number of items wanted in the storage (still not perfect, deactivated when that thing drops from a job, but an improment anyway).
<dd>Improvement: itemsettab: make it a large window.
<dd>Improvement: don't switch the main window to the bonus tab if the equipment changes. 
<dd>Improvement: sort the extras by alphabet.

<dd>Change: calculator: renamed 'event and others' to non-auctionable, to be more clear. added a blacklist for pay-to-win shit and extremely rare stuff.
<dd>Bugfix: craftwindow: it had a limit of 1000 units per crafting action, which has been removed. As a side effect the click on the max. number (in paratheses left of it) now doesn't use the 1000 anymore, and just works as intended.
<dd>Bugfix: craftwindow: solved the issue with the order of events, causing slow updates.
<dd>Bugfix: the speedcalc function judged animals by their speed bonus, not their base speed. Fixed.
<dd>Bugfix: speedcalc might have miscalculated by using the currently equipped animal. The bug was there, but whether it really is another question.
<dd>Bugfix: the storage tab could not be opened is you had one of the rare things for the level 600 crafting recipes in it (habaneros, cobra teeth and ...). in general it would fail if you included an item which is dropable, but without a specific job.
<dd>Bugfix: fixed the redraw problem of the minimap (extensions vanished)
<dd>Bugfix: since 0.52 the equipment calculator didn't like floating point input anymore, but i still sent that. Stupid me.
<dd>Bugfix: the calculation of the time needed to collect resources for crafted stuff did almost everything right, but didn't multiply the times with the number of resources. "Almost right" is the same as "totally wrong".
<dd>Bugfix: removed a duplicate setting for the market.
<dd>Bugfix: equipment tab: wear button didn't work.
<dd>Bugfix: sleep helper: now caches forts w/o barracks, too, for dying montana.
<dd>Bugfix: item set tab: click on the set didn't open the set window.

<dt>0.54 - 2023-05-26
<dd>New: a new extra, the simulator, allows targeted exploration of any equipment known to the game (you can see how usefull a new piece of equipment would be).
<dd>New: a replacement for the craftwindow, allowing you to buy from and sell on the market, start a job, ... and craft, of course.
<dd>Improvement: the jobwindow shows collectible items dropped by that job in the title.
<dd>Improvement: craft item list is reloaded as soon as a new recipe is learned.
<dd>Improvement: a click on the storage area of the trackbar opens the storage tab.
<dd>Bugfix: the profile text click was too greedy.
<dd>Bugfix: overlay fortbattle value calculation should now match that of tw-calc (and the game, too).

<dt class='obsolete-marker'>0.53 - 2023-04-07
<dd>New: add a fortbattle data display to the overlay.
<dd>New: add a generic calculator (jobs, duels, fortbattle, you name it) to the extras.
<dd>New: add craftcalc, a calculator for the items needed when crafting.
<dd>New: add option to change the payment default to the event currency (easter eggs and so on) instead of nuggets

<dd>New: add two additional modes to the speed calculation.
<dd>New: added option to highlight bonus jobs to the job list.
<dd>New: friend list (sortable, always reachable, with class/profession).

<dd>Improvement: chest opening statistics for valentine and easter events
<dd>Improvement: collections: add direct search for the matching job to the collection window (new dropable collection items).
<dd>Improvement: collections: allow to search in town shops 
<dd>Improvement: gencalc: change subset limit to 1000, for the sleepyhead set (might not be an improment on weak machines, though).
<dd>Improvement: make the coords clickable in the other half of the minimap gold/silver export, too.
<dd>Change: moved the job tab to extras and an own window.
<dd>Bugfix: disregard HP when calculating a regeneration set.
<dd>Bugfix: fix the question text when changing the name of a duellstat equipment set.
<dd>Bugfix: fort battle statistics were broken if an attacker was killed in the first round
<dd>Bugfix: reduce the localstorage space needed by more than 90%.
<dd>Bugfix: set display: item levels have not been initialized in any case, leading to an empty display.
<dd>Internal: bit the next bullet and started to modularize the CSS stuff.
<dd>Internal: bit the bullet and started to modularize the translations.
<dd>Old: re-add the fix for the compost recipe display (twcalc workaround)

<dd>Improvement: The set display can now handle item leveling.
<dt>0.51 - 2022-12-19
<dd>New: Add a navigation option to the minimap, off by default. This also implements the search mode, where the user interface is transparent. Try the cursor keys when in search mode.
<dd>New: added an option to go to the profile text editor when clicking on your own profile text.
<dd>New: a shift-click on the number in the upper right corner of an inventory item will open the item in the usage tab, so you can see where it is used. I had to replace the scrollbar for that.
<dd>New: Implement an information overlay containing character and equipment information, and a easiely seen note area. That duell stuff still is bound to change.
<dd>New: display chance for lucky find in the job window.
<dd>New: add buttons to start as much jobs as possible in the same motivation class.
<dd>New: Since the number of tabs grew to far, i exiled a number of functions to the Extras tab, where you can open these functions in new windows. Moved WUW there.
<dd>New: add a collections helper and a list of missing items (Extras/Collections).
<dd>New: show the currently available quests at all quest givers.
<dd>New: item usage / chest opening stats.
<dd>New: add time to collect items to the items popup (assuming no VIP, no adventurer bonus, no product drop chance enhancements, and not reaching 5 gold stars).

<dd>Improvement: Many things translated to german. Still quite a lot of english visible.
<dd>Improvement: The startup code waits for the itemmanager to be loaded. This also fixes a number of cases where duellstat tried to run before TW was ready (causing DS to fail).
<dd>Improvement: Market buy: add some filters. This is still not quite free of bugs.
<dd>Improvement: Jobs tab: highlight jobs with known gold/silver instances.
<dd>Bugfix: the barrack search (sleep function) doesn't uncache fully built barracks anymore.

<dt>0.50 - 2022-11-16

<dd>New: option to always show the "max" button at the traveling merchant.
<dt>0.49 - 2022-11-15

<dd>New: option to add safety question before a quest cancellation. 
<dd>New: clicking on a set name, in the sets tab, now opens a window showing the set and it's data, optionally including the items. No dependency on TWX anymore (which was a bit problematic because it only worked if TWX had been called before (forbid list not loaded otherwise). Besides… this now even works for very new sets.
<dd>New: trackbar replacement.
<dd>New: option to warn if the daily tasks have not been done
<dd>New: option to mark the tracker, if there are finishable tasks.

<dt>0.46 - 2022-11-05
<dd>New: You can add buttons to switch to another set to the jobwindow (only if you have the higher income premium, because its place is used).

<dd>Bugfix: the button background was broken for longer buttons.
<dd>Bugfix: the fortbattle statistics were ugly when the battle was rather unbalanced.
<dd>0.45 not release, the version was burned to check the release process

<dd>New: The Updateinfo tab (you are here).
<dd>New: The Sets tab, showing a list of all sets, and the bonus value you would have with them.
<dd>New: Item count display in the quest window, and the quest tracker window. Both have to be enabled in the settings (clothcalc has a similar feature).
<dd>New: Banking helpers:
	<ul>
	<li>A click on the money in the bank (at the top of the game) allows you to deposit your cash, if you are in a town. This is enabled by default.
	<li>You can be asked if you want to deposit your money if you reach your home town. This has to be enabled in the settings, because clothcalc has the same feature, and it would be annoying be asked twice.
	</ul>
<dd>New: Enhancements to the auction window (like clothcalc did). These are turned off by default, because clothcalc does the same, and <b>because there are a number of rough edges</b> (meaning: this feature is not completed). It is here because it is usable.
<dd>New: Option to create a button in the graveyard, leading to basic fortbattle statistics. Yes, i mean basic. I did not dig into the per-round data.
<dd>New: the settings are ordered.
<dd>Bugfix: if an english translation was missing, at warning was issued on the console. This was not meant to be.
<dd>Bugfix: if translations in another language were missing, they were logging as often as they were used. This was unneeded.
<dd>Bugfix: in many cases the wrong CDN was used (impact: none).
